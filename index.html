              IEEE Industrial Applications Society, a group of undergraduates at
              VIT, is dedicated to build a bridge between enthusiasm and excellence
              by providing a platform for brainstorming solutions to the industrial
              world, through the largest research conferences, expert talks,
              seminars, and boot camps. We link research to practice, thereby
              connecting students to industry experts. To promote technology among
              the students even during the pandemic, we organised a variety of
              productive technical sessions, Hackathons, Techathons, and Ideathons,
              as well as some other events.
