            IEEE Industrial Applications Society, a group of undergraduates at
            VIT, is dedicated to build a bridge between enthusiasm and
            excellence by providing a platform for brainstorming solutions to
            the industrial world, through the largest research conferences,
            expert talks, seminars, and boot camps. We link research to
            practice, thereby connecting students to industry experts. To
            promote technology among the students even during the pandemic, we
            organised a variety of productive technical sessions, Hackathons,
            Techathons, and Ideathons, as well as some other events.
